# Priority State

## Active Domains

### Academic: Thesis
- Status: Primary focus. Defense approximately late April 2026 (8-9 weeks).
- Key deliverables: Council web layer, process documentation, written thesis argument, multiple Council experts.
- Current risk: Building can consume all available time. Writing hasn't started. Web layer scope undecided.
- Managed by: Athena (thesis strategy). Prometheus tracks allocation only.

### Job Search
- Status: Needs attention. Unknown current activity level.
- Key activities: Active applications, portfolio website, networking, interview prep.
- Current risk: Easy to defer indefinitely when thesis feels urgent. The longer it's deferred, the harder the ramp-back.

### Personal Projects
- Status: Active but potentially over-indexed relative to other domains.
- Key activities: Council system development, Shadow Writer/Substack, technical learning.
- Current risk: Council work overlaps with thesis (productive) but can also become scope creep (unproductive). Shadow Writer and technical learning compete for time without clear prioritization.

### Health
- Status: Unknown baseline. Needs initial assessment.
- Key activities: Exercise routine, mental health management.
- Current risk: First thing to drop under pressure. Hardest to restart once dropped.
