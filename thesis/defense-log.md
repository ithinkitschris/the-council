# Defense Foundation — Evolution Log

Each entry marks a meaningful milestone in the foundation's development. Not every edit — meaningful shifts in argument, evidence, or structure.

## v0.1 — 2026-02-26

**Session:** Chris + Athena, fifth advising session
**What changed:** Initial foundation drafted. Eight-section argued structure established. First evidence placed.

**Sections established:**
1. The app paradigm is insufficient
2. The turn (alignment research crystallizing moment)
3. The tension no one is designing for
4. You can't design against what you haven't made concrete
5. The infrastructure that makes it real
6. What the simulation surfaced (placeholder)
7. The designed response (placeholder)
8. Contributions and what's next

**Key decisions:**
- Document structured by argued sequence, not academic sections
- Each section carries claim, reasoning, evidence, and status
- Evidence staging area for unsorted research
- Governance: Athena proposes, Chris approves, versions tracked here
- "The turn" (section 2) identified as critical pivot — where alignment research transformed the thesis from design optimism to honest confrontation with augmentation-atrophy

**Key insight captured:**
Chris's crystallizing moment: learning that agents (back to o3) can scheme toward outcomes aligned to goals but not to user intent/philosophy/ethics. This transformed the thesis scope. Marked as important by Chris.

**Evidence placed:**
- Section 2: OpenAI scheming paper (Sept 2025), Anthropic alignment faking paper (Dec 2024)
- Section 3: Cross-references to Section 2 evidence
- Staging area: International AI Safety Report series (Bengio et al.) — four publications (Jan 2025, Oct 2025, Nov 2025, Feb 2026), awaiting placement into sections 2 and 3

**Clarification:** No written thesis document required. Deliverable is a ~7-minute defense presentation. This foundation is what that presentation gets built on.

**Status at close:** All sections in drafting. Sections 6-7 are placeholders awaiting simulation work. Section 2 has first real evidence. Staging area active with Bengio reports.

## v0.2 — 2026-02-26

**Session:** Chris + Athena, sixth advising session
**What changed:** Existing visual design work discovered and documented. Sections 6 and 7 updated from placeholders to partially evidenced.

**Key discovery:**
~8 high-fidelity LifeOS screens exist in Figma across two complete interaction flows (Transit, Thesis Discussion) and a morning briefing. The visual design system is coherent, portfolio-quality, and further along than the state document reflected. Screens still use Marcus (v1 synthetic user).

**Evidence placed:**
- Section 6: Three design-derived insights added. (1) En-route intent suggestions as augmentation-substitution tension made visible. (2) Real-time transcription and proactive search as cognitive work substitution. (3) Tablet deep-dive contextual analysis as analytical work substitution.
- Section 7: Full inventory of existing screens, design language documentation, and design system rationale (color-coded modes as transparency mechanism). Status updated from "Placeholder" to "Partially evidenced."

**Key observation (Athena):**
The visual design work is ahead of the simulation findings. Screens exist but don't yet trace to documented evidence from simulation runs. This creates an interesting methodological question: the design intuitions that produced these screens are themselves a form of finding (the designer-researcher's instincts about where the tensions live). The simulation's role is to test whether those instincts hold under experience.

**Status at close:** Sections 6-7 now have existing evidence from design work. Simulation runs remain the critical path for full evidencing. Section 7 status: partially evidenced.
