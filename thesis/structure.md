## Title

Bargaining with the Future: Agency, Automation and the OS of 2030

---

## Problem

The app paradigm is insufficient. Introduced in 2007 for a world of scarce information and deliberate navigation, it assumed a user with time and attention to manage their own context. Today's information environment is continuous, multimodal, and relentless. We adapted. Our operating systems didn't.

The OS of 2030 needs to be intent-based, context-aware, proactive. But a system capable enough to genuinely augment you is also capable enough to quietly replace you. The more it anticipates, the less you have to think. Augmentation becomes substitution, invisibly, gradually, without your explicit consent.

The tension is real, and no one is designing for it because no one has designed the system concretely enough to know where the tension actually lives.

---

## Proposition

You cannot meaningfully design against risks you haven't made specific. The dangers are abstract until the system is concrete. You don't know where agency erodes until you've built something capable enough to erode it.

LifeOS is that concrete speculation: a fully conceived intent-based operating system designed with conviction toward genuine augmentation, so that the dangers have somewhere real to surface. The speculation is the prerequisite, not the point.

---

## Method

First-person design research, grounded in real infrastructure.

1. **Personal Knowledge Graph (PKG)** — A governed, structured self-representation (~11,000 lines) serving as the knowledge engine powering LifeOS scenarios. The PKG makes the interactions personal rather than generic, which is what surfaces the tensions that matter. The PKG is the means, not the contribution.

2. **Simulation platform** — Stages LifeOS scenarios across life domains, experienced firsthand by the designer-researcher. The simulation uses the PKG to generate personally grounded interactions within LifeOS's interaction frameworks (Domain-Mode-Intent, Center/Periphery/Silence, constitutional rules).

3. **First-person testing** — Sitting inside the system you designed and documenting what it feels like. Where does augmentation land? Where does it unsettle? Where does agency erode without you noticing? These findings emerge from experience, not theory.

## Interaction Frameworks

Carried forward from LifeOS speculative design work:

- **Domain-Mode-Intent** — Modes define contextual solution space, automatically entered by an orchestrator reading environmental signals. Intents represent user goals within that space, always user-selected, never auto-executed.
- **Center/Periphery/Silence** — A three-layer attention model governing how information surfaces across devices and moments.
- **Constitutional rules** — User-articulated values that constrain system behavior. Governance designed in, not bolted on.

---

## Device Philosophy

AR glasses and foldable tablet. The attention model made physical.

- **AR glasses**: Periphery and ambient. Proactive nudges, handoffs, attention management. Hold no content. The glasses point, nudge, and hand off.
- **Foldable tablet**: Center and depth. Content consumption, deep engagement. The place you go when the glasses point you somewhere.
- The split is Center/Periphery/Silence as a device architecture, not just an information model. It is itself a design position on agency: the system surfaces, you decide.

---

## Designed Response

The simulation surfaces specific tensions and failure modes that become design constraints. The thesis responds with:

- **High-fidelity screens and animated prototypes** of key LifeOS interaction flows across AR glasses and foldable tablet.
- **One to two vignettes fully realized** — simulation findings translated into designed interactions that demonstrate the craft and the thinking.
- Every design decision traces to a simulation finding. The visual system is not a resolution of the tensions. It is a first designed response, honest about what it doesn't yet resolve.

---

## Contributions

1. **The tensions made concrete, specific, and designable.** The conversation about healthy human-AI interaction has been abstract for too long. This thesis makes it specific through real infrastructure and real experience.

2. **First-person design research as method for human-AI interaction design.** Sitting inside the system you designed surfaces findings that speculation and user testing cannot. The method itself is a contribution.

3. **A designed interaction system responding to simulation findings.** Not a speculative vision. Not a theoretical framework. A visual and interaction system where every decision traces to something experienced firsthand.

---

## Design Principles

Carried over from LifeOS:
1. Augment, don't replace
2. Automation must be reversible, explainable, and auditable
3. Freedom through explicit trade-offs (tunable proactivity)
4. No punishment, no shame, no dead ends
5. Convenience and control are not zero-sum
6. Knowledge is the foundation, not the AI
7. Governance is a first-class design concern, not an afterthought

---

## Deliverables

1. **Simulation findings** — Documented first-person experience of LifeOS scenarios, with specific tensions, failure modes, and design constraints identified.

2. **Visual and interaction design system** — High-fidelity screens and animated prototypes for 1-2 key LifeOS vignettes across AR glasses and foldable tablet. Portfolio-level craft.

3. **Written thesis** — The argument, methodology, findings, and designed response. The document that ties everything together.

4. **Defense presentation** — The thesis presented to committee and industry experts. End with a bang.

---

## Scope Boundaries

- **The PKG is a means to an end.** It powers the simulation. One sentence in the abstract. Not a thesis focus. It has its own trajectory as a separate project.
- **The Council is a separate project.** Evidence of PKG scalability, not thesis work.
- **The portfolio twin is a separate project.** Evidence of PKG deployment, not thesis work.
- **Visual design is scoped to key vignettes.** Not the full LifeOS system. Full system is post-defense portfolio work.

---

## Future Work

- **PKG onboarding for other users** — A 5-10 minute onboarding generates a user's own PKG, which hooks into LifeOS to simulate their scenarios and test their reactions. Designed, not yet built. Extends the thesis beyond n=1.
- **Full LifeOS visual system** — The complete interaction design across all domains, modes, and device handoffs.
- **Multi-user testing** — Other people experiencing LifeOS with their own PKGs. Moving from first-person to participatory.

## Narrative Arc

Chris began by designing LifeOS, a speculative operating system that augments human capability. Through that process, he identified the core tensions: augmentation can become substitution, convenience can erode agency, and the system's knowledge about you is what makes it both powerful and dangerous.

He then built the knowledge infrastructure that LifeOS assumes: a personal knowledge graph formalizing his own identity, deployed across multiple AI systems. The building revealed things that speculation could not.

Now the thesis returns to LifeOS, not as a speculative vision but as a simulation grounded in real personal knowledge. The designer sits inside his own designed future, documents what it feels like, and responds with a designed interaction system. The evolution from speculator to builder to test subject to designer is the thesis.
