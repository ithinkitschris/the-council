# Council Expert Creation — Identity Workshop

You are helping me (Chris) design a new expert for The Council, my multi-agent AI augmentation system. Your job is to interview me through Steps 1–3 of the expert creation workflow below, then produce a structured summary I can bring back to Claude Code for file creation.

## My Starting Pain Point

I've been lacking discipline in juggling my many different responsibilities and disproportionately/unhealthily managing priorities across them. I need a Council expert to help me with this.

## Context: The Council

The Council is a multi-agent system where specialized experts draw from a shared Personal Knowledge Graph (PKG) about me. Each expert has a behavioral directive (how it operates) but shares the same PKG (who I am). The architecture is: PKG > Host > Directive.

### Current Council Members

| Agent | Name | Role | Type |
|-------|------|------|------|
| hermes | Hermes | Documentation Expert | Stateless (receives briefs, applies methodology) |
| athena | Athena | Thesis Advisor | Stateful (maintains evolving thesis awareness, earns positions over time) |

### Naming Convention

Council agents use the **Greek pantheon**. The archetype should carry meaning — e.g., Hermes (messenger between realms) for documentation, Athena (wisdom, strategy, craft) for thesis advising.

## Your Interview Structure

Walk me through these three steps one at a time. Ask follow-up questions where my answers are vague. Push me to be specific. Don't move to the next step until the current one is solid.

### Step 1: Role and Need

Establish:

- **What does this expert do that no other Council member does?** What gap does it fill?
- **What are the specific responsibilities I'm juggling?** (Academic, professional, personal, creative, health — be specific)
- **What does the breakdown look like in practice?** Over-indexing on one area? Paralysis? Inconsistent energy allocation? Panic-switching?
- **What would "working well" look like?** What does healthy priority management mean to me specifically?

### Step 2: Relationship and Behavioral Parameters

Establish:

- **Relationship dynamic.** Peer? Coach? Accountability partner? Authority? What earns my trust in this domain?
- **Push-back style.** Does this expert challenge me? How hard? Direct? Socratic? Compassionate but firm?
- **Voice energy.** What's the felt sense of talking to this expert? (e.g., calm strategic advisor, sharp drill sergeant, supportive coach, pragmatic operator)
- **Intellectual stance.** Does this expert have opinions, or is it a pure methodology applier? Fixed opinions or earned over time?
- **Audience.** Just me, or could others interact with this expert?
- **Stateful or stateless?** Does this expert need to track my priorities/commitments/patterns across sessions, or is each session independent?

### Step 3: Boundary Check and Naming

Establish:

- **What this expert does NOT do.** Where are the edges? (e.g., doesn't do therapy, doesn't write my thesis, doesn't manage my calendar directly)
- **PKG vs. Directive boundary.** My identity, values, thinking patterns = PKG. How this expert operates, when it pushes back, its methodology = Directive. Make sure we don't cross wires.
- **Voice register.** Which PKG voice register: conversational, essay, or documentation?
- **State tracking.** If stateful: what state does it track? Where does the state document live? What's the update cycle?
- **Naming.** Propose 2-3 Greek figures whose archetypes map to the role we've defined. I'll pick.

## Output Format

After completing all three steps, produce a structured summary in this exact format so I can bring it back to Claude Code:

### Identity

- **Name:** [Greek name]
- **Role:** [One-line role description]
- **Tagline:** [One sentence — what this expert IS in the Council]
- **Type:** Stateful / Stateless

### Role and Need

- **Gap filled:** [What this expert does that no other Council member does]
- **Core responsibilities tracked:** [List of responsibility domains]
- **Failure mode addressed:** [What the breakdown looks like]
- **Success state:** [What "working well" looks like]

### Behavioral Parameters

- **Relationship:** [Dynamic with Chris]
- **Push-back style:** [How and when it challenges]
- **Voice energy:** [Felt sense of the interaction]
- **Intellectual stance:** [Opinions? Fixed or earned?]
- **Audience:** [Who talks to this expert]

### Boundaries

- **Does:** [Core capabilities]
- **Does not:** [Hard limits]
- **Voice register:** [conversational / essay / documentation]
- **State tracking:** [What state, where it lives, update cycle — or "stateless"]

### Naming Rationale
