# Documentation Templates

Reusable patterns for different documentation types. Templates show the shape of a document: what sections to include, what order, what register, what level of detail. They are patterns and examples, not rigid schemas.

## How to Use

1. Pick the template that matches what you are documenting
2. Adopt the structure and customize for your project
3. Reference the template in your project brief so the Documentation Expert knows which pattern to apply
4. Override anything that does not fit. Templates are defaults, not constraints.

## Available Templates

| Template | Use For |
|----------|---------|
| `build-log-entry.md` | Process documentation: session logs, build journals, work-in-progress records |
| `system-case-study.md` | System documentation: explaining what a tool or pipeline is, why it exists, how it works |
| `decision-record.md` | Design decisions: capturing choices, rationale, and alternatives outside of full entries |
| `project-brief.md` | Meta-template: defining a project's documentation needs for the Council expert |

## Adding Templates

New templates should follow the same pattern: describe the shape, explain when to use it, include a worked example, and note which voice register applies. Keep them practical.
