# Career State

Last updated: 2026-02-26
Updated by: Chris + Apollo (networking strategy revision: Apple HI cold connects as parallel track, not held fallback)

---

## Current Focus

A senior creative bringing 8 years of craft and brand thinking into the frontier of human-AI interaction. That's the positioning line, confirmed in session. It leads with seniority in what Chris actually is (a senior creative), frames the advertising background as an asset rather than a departure, and points directly at the frontier he's working on.

Target level: senior. Not mid-level. The instinct to self-correct down to mid-level was interrogated and found to be a gut read without supporting evidence, running against the one concrete data point available (Apple HI recruiter screen from a cold application). Decision: target senior and let the market provide real calibration rather than pre-filtering based on an unchecked assumption.

Timeline: Final stretch of MFA (defense ~late April 2026). Available to start July 2026. Job search running in parallel with thesis. Urgency is building.

## Active Job Search

**Status:** In between — applying to open positions, but not yet fully in it. Networking has not started in earnest.

**Target role types:** Two lanes, same person. (1) Senior interaction design, product design, or creative technology roles at the intersection of AI, product, and craft — Apple HI, Anthropic, creative technology studios. (2) Senior creative / art director roles at brand and advertising shops that need someone who bridges traditional craft with digital and interaction — Pentagram, Wieden+Kennedy, Mother, Media Arts Lab. Leading with seniority in creative direction, brand, and craft, not trying to prove seniority in pure product design case studies. The roles that will want Chris are the ones that value the cross-disciplinary range, not the ones that evaluate on shipped product metrics alone. Not standard PM-adjacent UX roles.

**Geographic scope:** Open to anywhere. No constraints. Bay Area (Apple, Anthropic), NYC, or elsewhere are all viable.

**Earliest start date:** July 2026 (post-defense, post-graduation).

**Portfolio & LinkedIn:** Both current and strong. Not a blocker.

---

## Dream Companies

- **Apple** — Explicitly named, no hedging. Has influenced Chris across every career stage: student, Motion Designer, Art Director, now IxD. The dream is being inside the machine that executes the brand-product intersection better than anyone. HI team is the natural target.
- **Anthropic** — AI safety and ethics focus aligned with thesis research. Respects their brand narrative and art direction (4:3, film). A genuine intellectual connection, not just a career move.
- **Rivian** — Cheek, wit, brand-forward product design. The Gary/Gear Guard mascot, Unreal Engine interface design. Fun, inspired work.

## Positioning

### Core positioning story
**The line:** "I'm a senior creative bringing 8 years of craft and brand thinking into the frontier of human-AI interaction."

Confirmed in session 2026-02-26. This is the anchor. It's true, specific, doesn't apologize for what's missing, and leads with what makes Chris genuinely rare. It frames the advertising background as the foundation, not the thing being left behind.

The intersection of skillsets is the value proposition, not any single discipline. Art direction, motion, brand, interaction design, and frontier AI thinking functioning as a force multiplier, not supplementary experience.

Why someone should hire him over another senior designer: "My perspectives and intersection of my skillsets and the fact that I am really good at craft, that is not common from my experience."

### The thesis as career asset
"Bargaining with the Future: Agency, Automation and the OS of 2030." The natural pitch: "Our phones still run on an interaction paradigm from 2007, and I'm designing what a real update looks like in 2030, one actually built to augment how you think, not just reduce friction. A system capable enough to genuinely augment you is also capable enough to quietly replace you. Started optimistic. Got complicated. That's honestly where it got interesting."

This framing is highly legible to Apple HI and Anthropic. Less legible to standard product design hiring pipelines.

### The core positioning tension
The market selects for people who fit neatly into predefined role boxes. Chris doesn't fit neatly. The work is making the intersection itself the value proposition, not apologizing for not fitting a box.

### The seniority calibration
Chris's initial instinct was to target mid-level to senior, reasoning that his advertising seniority doesn't translate directly to tech/product design. The gap he named: no professional product/tech experience, no shipped product case studies. Real gap, but the framing "I'm just a pivoter" was identified as underselling, consistent with the documented pattern of radical self-underselling. The decision: target senior, because (1) the roles that will want him specifically are evaluating for the senior-level qualities he already has (craft depth, creative direction, brand-system thinking, frontier AI work), and (2) targeting mid-level puts him in a pool where his differentiation disappears and he competes on pure product case study depth, which is his weakest axis. Let the market provide the correction if it's needed, rather than pre-correcting.

### What's landing
Cold application to Apple HI got a recruiter screen — the profile is compelling enough to earn a first look without a referral. This is a positive signal about the resume/portfolio.

### What's not landing
*Not yet established — to be captured as search progresses.*

---

## Active Applications

### Apple — HI / Interaction Design
- **Status:** Recruiter screen completed. Did not proceed — role required ASAP start, Chris unavailable until July 2026.
- **How it closed:** Recruiter said they would be "happy to reconsider for other roles in the future." Door left open.
- **Follow-up status:** Draft written. Sending window: mid-to-late March 2026.
- **Timing rationale:** Recruiter said to reach out closer to April/May. Mid-to-late March is close enough to that window to feel natural, far enough ahead to not land in the same week as every other candidate. Reaching out now would contradict the timeline they set. Waiting until April cold means reintroducing yourself.
- **Follow-up strategy:** Combine thread-maintenance with portfolio testing ask. One message, two purposes. Lead with the portfolio ask (genuine, bounded, specific), close with the timeline reference (July start, continued interest in HI). The portfolio ask is the reason for writing. The job interest is a natural close, not the opening thesis.
- **Draft (working, to be refined before send):**

> Hi [name],
>
> I've been building something for my portfolio since we last spoke and I'd genuinely love a recruiter's take on it, specifically yours if you have about 5 minutes.
>
> It's a conversational AI experience where visitors talk to a digital twin of me, powered by a personal knowledge graph. I know that sounds like a lot, but it's easier to just try it than explain it.
>
> If you do, three things I'd ask you to notice:
> 1. At the start, when you pick how to describe your visit, do any of the options feel like how you'd actually evaluate a candidate? Or do they miss?
> 2. When the result comes back, does it tell you what you'd want to know? Or is it a lot of words around not much?
> 3. Gut check: genuinely useful, or a gimmick?
>
> And honestly the one question that matters most to me: would you send this link to a hiring manager?
>
> I'm also still very interested in HI roles for a July start, happy to talk more whenever the timing makes sense.
>
> [link]
>
> Chris

- **Next step:** QA the portfolio recruiter path end-to-end before this sends. The message points someone at Apple at the experience. It has to be airtight.

## Networking

### Current state
Not yet started. Chris has identified networking as something he wants to do but hasn't acted on it.

### The block
Two things: (1) it feels transactional — like asking for something with nothing to offer in return, and (2) he doesn't know how to start the conversation without it feeling fake. This is a values conflict, not a skills gap. Chris's natural mode is genuine engagement and substantive conversation, not performance. The path forward is outreach that leads with intellectual curiosity and shared interests, not with asks.

### The bridge: recruiter outreach as portfolio user testing
An existing plan (from portfolio project) solves both friction points at once. The idea: reach out to in-house tech recruiters at target companies and ask them to user-test the AI-flow portfolio (ithinkitschris.com). Framed as seeking their professional perspective, not as a job inquiry. The ask is tiny — 5 minutes, honest reaction, no obligation. This doubles as light networking because:
- **Not transactional** — you're offering them something to react to, not asking for a favor. You're seeking their expertise on a real product.
- **Not fake** — the ask is genuine. You actually want the feedback.
- **Targets the right people** — in-house tech recruiters at companies you'd actually want to work at. Apple, Anthropic, Rivian.

The Apple recruiter who screened Chris is a natural first candidate — an existing relationship, and the portfolio is the exact thing they've already evaluated. The ask is professional feedback, not "please hire me." This reframes the Apple follow-up from a cold thread-maintenance email into a genuine engagement with a specific ask.

**Outreach framing (drafted):** "I'm building something different for my portfolio and I'd love a recruiter's honest gut reaction — takes about 5 minutes. I have three specific things I'd ask you to notice while you explore, so you don't have to think hard about what to look for."

**Three things to notice:**
1. At the very start — when you're asked to describe your visit, does any of the options feel like you? Or do they miss how you actually think about candidates?
2. When you get the result — does the output tell you what you'd actually want to know about a candidate, or does it feel like a lot of words around not much?
3. Overall impression — does this feel like a genuinely useful tool, or a clever gimmick you'd click through once and forget?

**Closing question:** "Would you send this link to a hiring manager? Why or why not?" (Forces a real opinion. The answer and reasoning reveal more than any other question.)

**North star metric:** Yes/no ratio on "would you send this to a HM?"

### Connection Map (first documented 2026-02-26)

Chris's initial read was "mostly cold." The actual map is stronger than that. Three genuinely warm, directly relevant connections plus several viable second-degree paths. The gap isn't connections. It's activation.

**Tier 1: Warm + directly relevant (activate first)**

- **Program alumni, product designer at Apple HI.** Same MFA program, exact target team. This is the strongest Apple path beyond the recruiter. Shared context, shared faculty, shared experience. The natural conversation: "finishing up the program, would love to hear what it's like on HI." Not a cold LinkedIn message. A peer conversation.

- **Faculty member, product lead at Google DeepMind.** Chris is on good terms with this faculty. This is the bridge to Anthropic: the faculty is good friends with a product designer at Anthropic. The play isn't "connect me to your friend." It's a genuine conversation with the faculty about his world, with the Anthropic connection surfacing naturally or as a warm intro if earned.

- **Creative Director at Ogilvy NYC.** Working terms. This is the gateway into NYC creative shops. A CD at Ogilvy would know people at Pentagram, W+K, Mother, and similar shops. The play is catching up, sharing what Chris has been building, and letting the dots connect. Not "do you know anyone at..."

**Tier 2: Real touchpoint, needs reactivation**

- **Recruiter at Media Arts Lab LA.** Met in person ~3 years ago. Still at the office. MAL LA is a dream office (explicitly named by Chris as a target if Apple HI doesn't materialize). The reactivation mirrors the Apple recruiter play: lead with something genuine he's built, not "remember me?" Three years is a gap but an in-person meeting is a real touchpoint.

- **Head of design at Notion NYC.** On speaking terms, speaks occasionally, but the contact has been limited with his time. Don't push for more than he's giving. When they do speak, make sure he knows what Chris is building and where he's headed. Sometimes the value of a connection like this is a single well-timed mention to someone else.

**Tier 3: Exists but needs a bridge**

- **Friend → friend → product designer at Anthropic.** A second path to Anthropic. Don't activate until after the DeepMind faculty path is explored. Two paths to the same company is good, but don't burn both at once.

- **LinkedIn cold connects: Apple HI recruiters + designers.** Several accepted connections, no conversations. Apple HI is not one team — it's hundreds of designers across many siloed groups. The alumni and the recruiter who already screened Chris are the high-priority warm paths, but cold connects to HI designers in other groups are genuinely different doors into different parts of the org. These are a parallel low-intensity track: selectively engage designers whose work is genuinely interesting, build slow-burn visibility across the org. Not mass outreach, not "hey I'm interested in HI." Real interactions. Different purpose and energy investment from the warm paths, but not a fallback held in reserve.

- **LinkedIn cold connects: head of design + design lead at Rivian.** Exist but cold. A friend of a friend used to work as a designer at Rivian, but "used to" limits the value.

**Tier 4: Adjacent value**

- **Mentor, occupational therapist, NYU faculty.** Warm relationship, Chris holds him dear. Not a direct path to any target company. But inclusive design and accessibility are deeply relevant to LifeOS. Don't force this into a job search vehicle. If he knows people in design-for-health or accessible technology, that's a natural thread.

### Networking next steps
1. **QA the portfolio recruiter path end-to-end.** This gates all outreach. Nothing goes out until it's airtight.
2. **Apple recruiter follow-up: mid-to-late March.** Draft exists (see Active Applications above). Refine before sending.
3. **Apple HI alumni conversation.** Reach out as a peer from the same program. Genuine ask: what's it like on HI? This is the most natural conversation on the list.
4. **DeepMind faculty conversation.** Genuine engagement about his work. The Anthropic bridge surfaces from there, not before.
5. **Ogilvy CD catch-up.** Share what he's been building. Let the creative shop network emerge from a real conversation.
6. **MAL LA recruiter reactivation.** After portfolio QA is done. Same portfolio testing framing as the Apple recruiter ask.
7. **Identify in-house recruiters at Anthropic and Rivian** for portfolio testing outreach. Widen the funnel beyond existing connections.
8. **Slow-burn Apple HI visibility.** Parallel to warm paths: selectively engage cold-connected HI designers whose work is genuinely interesting. Real interactions, not networking spray. Build visibility across different parts of the org over time.

## Key Decisions Made

**Decision 1: Target senior level.**
Date: 2026-02-26.
Rationale: The instinct to target mid-level was a gut read without evidence, running against the available signal (Apple HI screen from cold app). The gap in product case studies is real but only disqualifying for roles that select primarily on that basis, which aren't the target roles. The "just a pivoter" framing was identified as the underselling tendency showing up in positioning decisions. Agreed approach: lead at the senior level, let the market calibrate.

**Decision 2: The positioning line is "I'm a senior creative bringing 8 years of craft and brand thinking into the frontier of human-AI interaction."**
Date: 2026-02-26.
Rationale: Chris confirmed this in session. It's true, specific, leads with established seniority, frames the advertising background as an asset, and points at the frontier. This is the anchor for all professional communications going forward.

**Decision 3: Resume gets tailored versions per target.**
Date: 2026-02-26.
Rationale: One-size-fits-all resume was underselling for Apple HI specifically. Chris is open to maintaining 2-3 tailored versions. Apple HI version drafted first, creative/brand version drafted second. Anthropic version to follow.

**Decision 4: Resume restructured — Current Work section above Experience.**
Date: 2026-02-26.
Rationale: The most differentiating work (thesis, digital twin, Stanford) wasn't on the resume at all because it predated those projects. Adding a Current Work section above Experience ensures Apple HI reads the frontier work first. The thesis, the AI-native portfolio, and the Stanford win are the strongest signals for this audience and they were completely absent.

**Decision 5: Two-lane job search — tech/product AND creative/brand.**
Date: 2026-02-26.
Rationale: Chris named Pentagram, Wieden+Kennedy, Mother, and Media Arts Lab as targets alongside Apple, Anthropic, and Rivian. The creative/brand lane positions him as a senior creative and maker who bridges traditional craft with interaction design and creative technology. Same person, different emphasis per audience. This required a second resume version with maker-focused experience descriptions, advertising pedigree leading, and the thesis reframed as speculative design rather than tech architecture.

**Decision 6: Creative/brand positioning is "maker who bridges disciplines," not "creative returning to advertising."**
Date: 2026-02-26.
Rationale: Chris's desired role at creative shops is bridging disciplines — bringing interaction design, motion, and digital craft into brand environments that don't have enough of it. Not going back to pure advertising. The "Who am I?" for this audience leads with maker identity ("never stopped making with my hands") and frames the tech expansion as creative technology, not an academic pivot. The MFA is the container, not the story.

## Resume — Apple HI Version (Drafted)

The current resume is dated (pre-thesis, pre-digital twin, pre-PKG). It positions Chris as an advertising creative pivoting into IxD. For Apple HI, it needs to position him as an interaction designer with advertising craft underneath. One page, hard constraint.

### Key structural changes
1. **Add "Current Work" section above Experience** — the thesis, the digital twin, and Stanford first place. This is what differentiates him from every other senior designer applying.
2. **Rewrite "Who am I?"** to lead with the positioning line and the thesis, not the advertising identity.
3. **Rewrite experience descriptions** to bridge advertising work to interaction design thinking (design decisions, systems, complexity, outcomes).
4. **Restructure skills** — lead with Interaction Design, Creative Direction, Motion Design, then technical stack. Cut Photography, Video Editing, Content Creation.
5. **Trim awards** — keep Cannes, One Show, Webby, Creative Circle. Cut Hashtag Awards, Singapore Youth Festival, Noise Singapore, Director's List. Stanford moves to Current Work.

### "Who am I?" — Apple HI version
> Singaporean-born, NYC-based senior creative bringing eight years of craft and brand thinking into the frontier of human-AI interaction. Art directed for Singapore Airlines, Nike, and Studio Ghibli.

## Resume — Creative / Brand Version (Drafted)

For Pentagram, Wieden+Kennedy, Mother, Media Arts Lab, and creative/brand shops. Positions Chris as a senior creative and maker who bridges traditional advertising craft with interaction design and creative technology. The advertising pedigree leads. The tech expansion is framed as creative technology, not academic pivot.

### Interview insights (extracted before drafting)
- **Day to day at these shops:** Bridging disciplines — the person who brings interaction design, motion, and digital craft into a brand/campaign environment that doesn't have enough of it.
- **Lead story:** Advertising pedigree first, but the new work matters too — framed as creative technology, not MFA. "The MFA doesn't matter much to me."
- **Thesis framing for this audience:** Keep it, but reframe hard. Strip the technical architecture, foreground speculative design ambition. "I designed an entire operating system from scratch" not "a three-layer attention model."
- **Desired gut reaction:** "This person is a maker."
- **Experience angle:** Craft and hands-on work + range across mediums. What Chris actually made, not scope descriptions.

### "Who am I?" — Creative / Brand version
> Singaporean-born, NYC-based Senior Creative with eight years across advertising, motion design, and art direction. Art directed for Singapore Airlines, IKEA, and Studio Ghibli. Storyboarded, animated, edited, and shipped across film, digital, spatial, and environmental. Never stopped making with my hands, even as the title changed. Now expanding that craft into interaction design and creative technology.

Note: Chris personalized this in Figma with "Hey!" opener and "(and I really mean never)" — his touches, sounds like him.

### Current Work section — Creative / Brand version
> **ithinkitschris.com — AI-Native Portfolio Experience**
> Conversational AI experience built as a creative technology project. Visitors talk to a digital twin powered by a personal knowledge graph. Built with Claude Code, React, Next.js.
>
> **Thesis — Bargaining with the Future**
> Speculative design project: a complete operating system for 2030, designed from scratch across AR glasses and foldable tablet. What happens when a system built to augment you starts replacing you instead.
>
> **Stanford Longevity Design Challenge 2025** — First Place

Note: Digital twin leads over thesis for this audience — it's more legible as creative technology.

### Experience — Maker-focused for creative shops
**Creative Lead — Marina Bay Sands (ArtScience Museum)**
> Designed the key visual and led the full integrated campaign for The World of Studio Ghibli, Singapore's first Ghibli exhibition. Digital OOH, cinema, print, merchandise, and environmental installations.

**Art Director — TBWA\ Singapore**
> Lead Art Director on Singapore Airlines. Pitched, art directed, storyboarded, and animated Beyond The Cabin across 6 episodes and 6 cities. Art directed the in-flight safety video, now playing on every SIA flight globally. Edited, color graded, and delivered the SilverKris Lounge launch film. Designed motion for the lounge's digital wall installation.

**Motion Art Director — BBH Singapore**
> Edited and motion designed 16 deliverables for Nike South-east Asia across @nike, @nikerunning, and @niketraining. Art directed Samsung CES 2020 on-site coverage and product content.

Important: Chris did NOT art direct Nike. He was video editor/motion designer on Nike. He art directed IKEA (not listed in BBH entry because it's not named in the experience — the brand is in the "Who am I?" line).

### Skills — Creative / Brand version
> Creative Direction, Motion Design, Art Direction, Product Design, Video Editing
> After Effects, Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom
> Figma, Blender, React.js, Next.js, Tailwind, JavaScript, Claude Code
> English (Native), Mandarin (Conversational)

Note: After Effects and motion tools lead. Dev stack (React, Next.js, etc.) is included because "Who am I?" claims creative technology — the dev stack is the evidence. Apollo flagged that listing Cursor/Antigravity/Ollama instead of the dev stack may not land with creative directors who don't know what those tools are.

### Awards — Creative / Brand version (less trimmed)
> Hashtag Awards 2023 — 2x Gold 1x Silver 3x Shortlist
> Cannes Lions 2021 — 1x Shortlist
> One Show 2021 — 1x Silver 1x Shortlist
> Webby Awards 2021 — 3x Winner
> Creative Circle Awards 2021 — 9x Gold 7x Silver 4x Bronze

Keeps Hashtag Awards (creative shops respect the trophy case). Still cuts Singapore Youth Festival, Noise Singapore, Director's List.

### Status
Done. Finalized in Figma.

## Immediate Action Items (Apollo's recommendation)

1. ~~**Finalize both resumes in Figma.**~~ Done.
2. ~~**Map 1-2 degree connections.**~~ Done. Full connection map documented above.
3. ~~**Apple recruiter message draft.**~~ Done. Working draft exists, sending window mid-to-late March.
4. **QA the recruiter path on ithinkitschris.com** — Run through it end-to-end. Make sure it's polished before anyone sees it. This gates all outreach.
5. **Apple HI alumni outreach** — Reach out as a peer from the same program. Most natural first conversation on the map.
6. **DeepMind faculty conversation** — Genuine engagement. The Anthropic bridge.
7. **Ogilvy CD catch-up** — Share what he's been building. Gateway to NYC creative shops.
8. **MAL LA recruiter reactivation** — After portfolio QA. Portfolio testing framing.
9. **Identify in-house recruiters at Anthropic and Rivian** — Portfolio testing outreach. Widen the funnel.
10. **Draft Anthropic resume version** — Third tailored version. What changes for that audience?

---

## Open Questions

1. ~~**Apple recruiter message draft.**~~ Resolved. Working draft exists.
2. **Portfolio recruiter path readiness** — Is the AI-flow recruiter experience actually polished enough to send right now, or does it need work first? This gates all outreach.
3. **Target company list beyond the dream three** — What else is on the radar? Pentagram, W+K, Mother, Media Arts Lab now added as creative/brand targets. MAL LA explicitly named as a dream office.
4. **Anthropic resume version** — What changes for that audience? To be drafted now that Apple HI and creative versions are finalized.
5. **Creative/brand resume skills section** — Chris's Figma version listed Cursor/Antigravity/Ollama instead of React/Next.js/Tailwind/JavaScript. Apollo flagged: the dev stack backs the "creative technology" claim in the summary. Needs Chris's final call.
6. **Activation sequencing** — The connection map is documented. The order of activation matters. Portfolio QA first, then Apple recruiter (mid-to-late March), then Apple HI alumni, then DeepMind faculty, then Ogilvy CD, then MAL LA. Parallel where possible but not all at once.
7. **What does the Apple HI alumni conversation look like?** — The play is clear (peer conversation, genuine ask about HI), but the specific outreach hasn't been shaped yet.

## Apollo's Developing Positions

*Positions appear here as they are earned through advising sessions — always marked with when they emerged and what evidence supports them. Chris reviews and can push back on any position.*

**Position 1: The intersection is the positioning, not the liability.**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, induction session.
Evidence: The PKG documents this tension explicitly — the market wants boxes, Chris doesn't fit them. But the intersection of advertising craft, interaction design, motion, and frontier AI thinking is genuinely rare. The positioning work is making that rarity legible, not fitting a label.
Confidence: High from PKG evidence. Needs validation against what's actually landing in the search.

**Position 2: The thesis is an underutilized career asset.**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, induction session.
Evidence: The LifeOS thesis framing is compelling and differentiated. "Designing the OS of 2030 and finding that a system capable enough to augment you is also capable enough to replace you" is a story Apple HI would read carefully. Whether it's actually being deployed in applications and conversations is unknown — this needs to be established.
Confidence: High on the asset's value. Unknown whether it's being used.

**Position 3: The Apple thread is warm and going cold.**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, first interview.
Evidence: Cold application earned a recruiter screen at the exact right team (HI/IxD). Recruiter explicitly left the door open for future roles. No follow-up has been sent. This is the highest-value connection in the current search and it's losing temperature every day.
Confidence: High. This is a concrete, actionable finding.

**Position 4: The networking block is a values conflict, not an inability.**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, first interview.
Evidence: Chris experiences outreach as transactional and performative, which conflicts with his core values (authenticity, genuine engagement, never self-promoting). The reframe: leading with intellectual curiosity about someone's work, then connecting it to his own, is genuine conversation — something he already knows how to do. The block dissolves when the framing shifts from "asking" to "engaging."
Confidence: High. Consistent with PKG values. Needs to be tested in practice.

**Position 5: The portfolio testing outreach is the networking vehicle.**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, first interview.
Evidence: An existing plan to reach out to in-house recruiters for portfolio user testing solves both networking friction points — it's not transactional (you're offering something to react to) and it's not fake (you genuinely want the feedback). It also directly targets the right people at the right companies. The Apple recruiter is the natural first recipient — an existing relationship plus a genuine ask. This collapses the "networking" and "portfolio validation" tracks into one action.
Confidence: High. The plan is drafted, the targets are clear, the framing is genuine.

**Position 6: "Just a pivoter" is the underselling pattern applied to career positioning.**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, seniority session.
Evidence: Chris's initial instinct was to target mid-level, framing himself as "just a pivoter" who lacks product case studies. When pressed, the basis was gut feel rather than market feedback or rejections. The available evidence (Apple HI screen from a cold application) contradicts the self-assessment. This maps directly to the documented pattern: radically undersells himself while being quietly certain of capabilities. The risk is that this tendency, left unchecked, would lead to targeting roles below his actual altitude and losing his differentiation in the process.
Confidence: High. Directly observed in session, consistent with PKG documentation.

**Position 7: The product case study gap is real but narrower than it feels.**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, seniority session.
Evidence: Chris has no shipped product with traditional product metrics. That's a genuine gap for roles that evaluate on those terms. But the roles worth targeting (Apple HI, Anthropic, creative technology studios) aren't selecting primarily on product case study depth. They're selecting for creative direction, frontier thinking, craft, and range. The thesis (designing an entire OS paradigm), the portfolio AI experience (a working product that earned a recruiter screen), and the advertising portfolio (Singapore Airlines, Nike, ArtScience Museum) are the portfolio. The gap matters less than it feels like it does, specifically because the right targets aren't looking at it the way a standard product design hiring pipeline would.
Confidence: High on reasoning. Needs validation as applications progress.

**Position 8: The resume was the biggest missed opportunity in the search.**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, resume review session.
Evidence: The resume submitted to Apple HI was dated — written before the thesis, digital twin, or PKG existed. It positioned Chris as an advertising creative pivoting into IxD, with no mention of AI, human-AI interaction, or the thesis anywhere. The "Who am I?" summary led with advertising identity aimed at no specific audience. Experience descriptions were thin scope statements without design decisions or outcomes. For Apple HI, the most differentiating work was completely absent from the document. The resume got a recruiter screen anyway (strong signal about the portfolio/brand logos), but it was working against the candidacy, not for it. The rewrite adds the thesis, digital twin, and Stanford first place in a new Current Work section, rewrites the summary around the positioning line, and bridges each experience entry to interaction design thinking.
Confidence: High. The gap was concrete and observable.

**Position 9: The same experience needs different language for different audiences.**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, creative/brand resume session.
Evidence: The Apple HI experience entries were written to bridge advertising to interaction design thinking — systems, complexity, design decisions. The creative/brand entries needed the opposite: maker language, hands-on craft, what Chris actually built with his hands. Same roles, same campaigns, completely different emphasis. "Led integrated campaign" (Apple HI) vs. "Pitched, art directed, storyboarded, and animated" (creative/brand). The first draft in Figma accidentally used the Apple HI descriptions for the creative version — caught in QA. This confirms the tailoring matters and isn't interchangeable.
Confidence: High. Directly observed.

**Position 10: The connection map is stronger than "mostly cold."**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, networking session.
Evidence: Chris's self-assessment was "mostly cold, some vague 1-2 degree connections." When mapped, the actual picture is three warm, directly relevant connections (Apple HI alumni from his program, DeepMind faculty with Anthropic bridge, Ogilvy CD with NYC creative shop access), two real touchpoints needing reactivation (MAL LA recruiter met in person, Notion head of design on speaking terms), and several viable second-degree paths. The "mostly cold" framing is the underselling pattern applied to social capital. The gap is activation, not connections.
Confidence: High. Directly documented in session.

**Position 11: The Apple recruiter follow-up timing is mid-to-late March, not now.**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, networking session.
Evidence: The recruiter said to reach out closer to April/May. Reaching out now contradicts the timeline they set. Waiting until April means reintroducing yourself cold. Mid-to-late March is the sweet spot: close enough to their window to feel natural, early enough to stay ahead of it. Chris's initial hesitation ("wouldn't it be weird to reach out now?") was the right instinct. The strategy accounts for it.
