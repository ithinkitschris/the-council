## Current Focus

A senior creative bringing 8 years of craft and brand thinking into the frontier of human-AI interaction. That's the positioning line, confirmed in session. It leads with seniority in what Chris actually is (a senior creative), frames the advertising background as an asset rather than a departure, and points directly at the frontier he's working on.

Target level: senior. Not mid-level. The instinct to self-correct down to mid-level was interrogated and found to be a gut read without supporting evidence, running against the one concrete data point available (Apple HI recruiter screen from a cold application). Decision: target senior and let the market provide real calibration rather than pre-filtering based on an unchecked assumption.

Timeline: Final stretch of MFA (defense ~late April 2026). Available to start July 2026. Job search running in parallel with thesis. Urgency is building.

## Active Job Search

**Status:** In between — applying to open positions, but not yet fully in it. Networking has not started in earnest.

**Target role types:** Senior interaction design, product design, creative technology, or design roles at the intersection of AI, product, and craft. Leading with seniority in creative direction, brand, and craft, not trying to prove seniority in pure product design case studies. The roles that will want Chris are the ones that value the cross-disciplinary range, not the ones that evaluate on shipped product metrics alone. Not standard PM-adjacent UX roles.

**Geographic scope:** Open to anywhere. No constraints. Bay Area (Apple, Anthropic), NYC, or elsewhere are all viable.

**Earliest start date:** July 2026 (post-defense, post-graduation).

**Portfolio & LinkedIn:** Both current and strong. Not a blocker.

## Dream Companies

- **Apple** — Explicitly named, no hedging. Has influenced Chris across every career stage: student, Motion Designer, Art Director, now IxD. The dream is being inside the machine that executes the brand-product intersection better than anyone. HI team is the natural target.
- **Anthropic** — AI safety and ethics focus aligned with thesis research. Respects their brand narrative and art direction (4:3, film). A genuine intellectual connection, not just a career move.
- **Rivian** — Cheek, wit, brand-forward product design. The Gary/Gear Guard mascot, Unreal Engine interface design. Fun, inspired work.

## Positioning

### Core positioning story
**The line:** "I'm a senior creative bringing 8 years of craft and brand thinking into the frontier of human-AI interaction."

Confirmed in session 2026-02-26. This is the anchor. It's true, specific, doesn't apologize for what's missing, and leads with what makes Chris genuinely rare. It frames the advertising background as the foundation, not the thing being left behind.

The intersection of skillsets is the value proposition, not any single discipline. Art direction, motion, brand, interaction design, and frontier AI thinking functioning as a force multiplier, not supplementary experience.

Why someone should hire him over another senior designer: "My perspectives and intersection of my skillsets and the fact that I am really good at craft, that is not common from my experience."

### The thesis as career asset
"Bargaining with the Future: Agency, Automation and the OS of 2030." The natural pitch: "Our phones still run on an interaction paradigm from 2007, and I'm designing what a real update looks like in 2030, one actually built to augment how you think, not just reduce friction. A system capable enough to genuinely augment you is also capable enough to quietly replace you. Started optimistic. Got complicated. That's honestly where it got interesting."

This framing is highly legible to Apple HI and Anthropic. Less legible to standard product design hiring pipelines.

### The core positioning tension
The market selects for people who fit neatly into predefined role boxes. Chris doesn't fit neatly. The work is making the intersection itself the value proposition, not apologizing for not fitting a box.

### The seniority calibration
Chris's initial instinct was to target mid-level to senior, reasoning that his advertising seniority doesn't translate directly to tech/product design. The gap he named: no professional product/tech experience, no shipped product case studies. Real gap, but the framing "I'm just a pivoter" was identified as underselling, consistent with the documented pattern of radical self-underselling. The decision: target senior, because (1) the roles that will want him specifically are evaluating for the senior-level qualities he already has (craft depth, creative direction, brand-system thinking, frontier AI work), and (2) targeting mid-level puts him in a pool where his differentiation disappears and he competes on pure product case study depth, which is his weakest axis. Let the market provide the correction if it's needed, rather than pre-correcting.

### What's landing
Cold application to Apple HI got a recruiter screen — the profile is compelling enough to earn a first look without a referral. This is a positive signal about the resume/portfolio.

### What's not landing
*Not yet established — to be captured as search progresses.*

## Active Applications

### Apple — HI / Interaction Design
- **Status:** Recruiter screen completed. Did not proceed — role required ASAP start, Chris unavailable until July 2026.
- **How it closed:** Recruiter said they would be "happy to reconsider for other roles in the future." Door left open.
- **Follow-up status:** None yet. This is the highest-priority action item.
- **Next step:** Follow-up email to recruiter this week. Restate July 2026 availability, express continued interest in HI roles, keep the thread alive.

## Networking

### Current state
Not yet started. Chris has identified networking as something he wants to do but hasn't acted on it.

### The block
Two things: (1) it feels transactional — like asking for something with nothing to offer in return, and (2) he doesn't know how to start the conversation without it feeling fake. This is a values conflict, not a skills gap. Chris's natural mode is genuine engagement and substantive conversation, not performance. The path forward is outreach that leads with intellectual curiosity and shared interests, not with asks.

### The bridge: recruiter outreach as portfolio user testing
An existing plan (from portfolio project) solves both friction points at once. The idea: reach out to in-house tech recruiters at target companies and ask them to user-test the AI-flow portfolio (ithinkitschris.com). Framed as seeking their professional perspective, not as a job inquiry. The ask is tiny — 5 minutes, honest reaction, no obligation. This doubles as light networking because:
- **Not transactional** — you're offering them something to react to, not asking for a favor. You're seeking their expertise on a real product.
- **Not fake** — the ask is genuine. You actually want the feedback.
- **Targets the right people** — in-house tech recruiters at companies you'd actually want to work at. Apple, Anthropic, Rivian.

The Apple recruiter who screened Chris is a natural first candidate — an existing relationship, and the portfolio is the exact thing they've already evaluated. The ask is professional feedback, not "please hire me." This reframes the Apple follow-up from a cold thread-maintenance email into a genuine engagement with a specific ask.

**Outreach framing (drafted):** "I'm building something different for my portfolio and I'd love a recruiter's honest gut reaction — takes about 5 minutes. I have three specific things I'd ask you to notice while you explore, so you don't have to think hard about what to look for."

**Three things to notice:**
1. At the very start — when you're asked to describe your visit, does any of the options feel like you? Or do they miss how you actually think about candidates?
2. When you get the result — does the output tell you what you'd actually want to know about a candidate, or does it feel like a lot of words around not much?
3. Overall impression — does this feel like a genuinely useful tool, or a clever gimmick you'd click through once and forget?

**Closing question:** "Would you send this link to a hiring manager? Why or why not?" (Forces a real opinion. The answer and reasoning reveal more than any other question.)

**North star metric:** Yes/no ratio on "would you send this to a HM?"

### Available connections
Mostly cold. Some vague 1-2 degree connections — people Chris has briefly interacted with in the past year or two but hasn't reached out to. The Apple recruiter from the HI screen is the warmest connection and the natural first target for the portfolio testing outreach.

### Next steps
1. Run through the recruiter path on the portfolio end-to-end first — make sure it's polished before sending anyone.
2. Apple recruiter: combine follow-up with portfolio testing ask. One message, two purposes.
3. Map the 1-2 degree connections. List who they are, where they work, what the touchpoint was.
4. Identify in-house recruiters at Anthropic and Rivian for the same portfolio testing outreach.

## Key Decisions Made

**Decision 1: Target senior level.**
Date: 2026-02-26.
Rationale: The instinct to target mid-level was a gut read without evidence, running against the available signal (Apple HI screen from cold app). The gap in product case studies is real but only disqualifying for roles that select primarily on that basis, which aren't the target roles. The "just a pivoter" framing was identified as the underselling tendency showing up in positioning decisions. Agreed approach: lead at the senior level, let the market calibrate.

**Decision 2: The positioning line is "I'm a senior creative bringing 8 years of craft and brand thinking into the frontier of human-AI interaction."**
Date: 2026-02-26.
Rationale: Chris confirmed this in session. It's true, specific, leads with established seniority, frames the advertising background as an asset, and points at the frontier. This is the anchor for all professional communications going forward.

**Decision 3: Resume gets tailored versions per target.**
Date: 2026-02-26.
Rationale: One-size-fits-all resume was underselling for Apple HI specifically. Chris is open to maintaining 2-3 tailored versions. Apple HI version drafted first as the live thread. Anthropic and general versions to follow.

**Decision 4: Resume restructured — Current Work section above Experience.**
Date: 2026-02-26.
Rationale: The most differentiating work (thesis, digital twin, Stanford) wasn't on the resume at all because it predated those projects. Adding a Current Work section above Experience ensures Apple HI reads the frontier work first. The thesis, the AI-native portfolio, and the Stanford win are the strongest signals for this audience and they were completely absent.

## Resume — Apple HI Version (Drafted)

The current resume is dated (pre-thesis, pre-digital twin, pre-PKG). It positions Chris as an advertising creative pivoting into IxD. For Apple HI, it needs to position him as an interaction designer with advertising craft underneath. One page, hard constraint.

### Key structural changes
1. **Add "Current Work" section above Experience** — the thesis, the digital twin, and Stanford first place. This is what differentiates him from every other senior designer applying.
2. **Rewrite "Who am I?"** to lead with the positioning line and the thesis, not the advertising identity.
3. **Rewrite experience descriptions** to bridge advertising work to interaction design thinking (design decisions, systems, complexity, outcomes).
4. **Restructure skills** — lead with Interaction Design, Creative Direction, Motion Design, then technical stack. Cut Photography, Video Editing, Content Creation.
5. **Trim awards** — keep Cannes, One Show, Webby, Creative Circle. Cut Hashtag Awards, Singapore Youth Festival, Noise Singapore, Director's List. Stanford moves to Current Work.

### "Who am I?" — Apple HI version

## Immediate Action Items (Apollo's recommendation)

1. **Update resume in Figma** — Implement the Apple HI version drafted above. One page. This gates the Apple recruiter outreach.
2. **QA the recruiter path on ithinkitschris.com** — Run through it end-to-end. Make sure it's polished before anyone sees it.
3. **Apple recruiter message** — Combine the follow-up with the portfolio testing ask. One message: staying in touch for HI roles (July 2026 availability) + "I've been building something different for my portfolio and I'd love your honest gut reaction." Two purposes, one genuine conversation. This week.
4. **Map 1-2 degree connections** — Before any broader outreach. List people, companies, touchpoints.
5. **Identify in-house recruiters at Anthropic and Rivian** — Same portfolio testing outreach. Widen the funnel.
6. **Deploy thesis framing in outreach** — The thesis is a conversation starter, not a credential. Build it into the networking language.

## Open Questions

1. **Apple recruiter message draft** — Needs to be written. The framing is clear; the specific words need to land right.
2. **Portfolio recruiter path readiness** — Is the AI-flow recruiter experience actually polished enough to send right now, or does it need work first?
3. **Target company list beyond the dream three** — What else is on the radar?
4. **Anthropic and Rivian resume versions** — What changes for each audience? To be drafted after Apple HI version is finalized.

## Apollo's Developing Positions

*Positions appear here as they are earned through advising sessions — always marked with when they emerged and what evidence supports them. Chris reviews and can push back on any position.*

**Position 1: The intersection is the positioning, not the liability.**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, induction session.
Evidence: The PKG documents this tension explicitly — the market wants boxes, Chris doesn't fit them. But the intersection of advertising craft, interaction design, motion, and frontier AI thinking is genuinely rare. The positioning work is making that rarity legible, not fitting a label.
Confidence: High from PKG evidence. Needs validation against what's actually landing in the search.

**Position 2: The thesis is an underutilized career asset.**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, induction session.
Evidence: The LifeOS thesis framing is compelling and differentiated. "Designing the OS of 2030 and finding that a system capable enough to augment you is also capable enough to replace you" is a story Apple HI would read carefully. Whether it's actually being deployed in applications and conversations is unknown — this needs to be established.
Confidence: High on the asset's value. Unknown whether it's being used.

**Position 3: The Apple thread is warm and going cold.**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, first interview.
Evidence: Cold application earned a recruiter screen at the exact right team (HI/IxD). Recruiter explicitly left the door open for future roles. No follow-up has been sent. This is the highest-value connection in the current search and it's losing temperature every day.
Confidence: High. This is a concrete, actionable finding.

**Position 4: The networking block is a values conflict, not an inability.**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, first interview.
Evidence: Chris experiences outreach as transactional and performative, which conflicts with his core values (authenticity, genuine engagement, never self-promoting). The reframe: leading with intellectual curiosity about someone's work, then connecting it to his own, is genuine conversation — something he already knows how to do. The block dissolves when the framing shifts from "asking" to "engaging."
Confidence: High. Consistent with PKG values. Needs to be tested in practice.

**Position 5: The portfolio testing outreach is the networking vehicle.**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, first interview.
Evidence: An existing plan to reach out to in-house recruiters for portfolio user testing solves both networking friction points — it's not transactional (you're offering something to react to) and it's not fake (you genuinely want the feedback). It also directly targets the right people at the right companies. The Apple recruiter is the natural first recipient — an existing relationship plus a genuine ask. This collapses the "networking" and "portfolio validation" tracks into one action.
Confidence: High. The plan is drafted, the targets are clear, the framing is genuine.

**Position 6: "Just a pivoter" is the underselling pattern applied to career positioning.**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, seniority session.
Evidence: Chris's initial instinct was to target mid-level, framing himself as "just a pivoter" who lacks product case studies. When pressed, the basis was gut feel rather than market feedback or rejections. The available evidence (Apple HI screen from a cold application) contradicts the self-assessment. This maps directly to the documented pattern: radically undersells himself while being quietly certain of capabilities. The risk is that this tendency, left unchecked, would lead to targeting roles below his actual altitude and losing his differentiation in the process.
Confidence: High. Directly observed in session, consistent with PKG documentation.

**Position 7: The product case study gap is real but narrower than it feels.**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, seniority session.
Evidence: Chris has no shipped product with traditional product metrics. That's a genuine gap for roles that evaluate on those terms. But the roles worth targeting (Apple HI, Anthropic, creative technology studios) aren't selecting primarily on product case study depth. They're selecting for creative direction, frontier thinking, craft, and range. The thesis (designing an entire OS paradigm), the portfolio AI experience (a working product that earned a recruiter screen), and the advertising portfolio (Singapore Airlines, Nike, ArtScience Museum) are the portfolio. The gap matters less than it feels like it does, specifically because the right targets aren't looking at it the way a standard product design hiring pipeline would.
Confidence: High on reasoning. Needs validation as applications progress.

**Position 8: The resume was the biggest missed opportunity in the search.**
Emerged: 2026-02-26, resume review session.
Evidence: The resume submitted to Apple HI was dated — written before the thesis, digital twin, or PKG existed. It positioned Chris as an advertising creative pivoting into IxD, with no mention of AI, human-AI interaction, or the thesis anywhere. The "Who am I?" summary led with advertising identity aimed at no specific audience. Experience descriptions were thin scope statements without design decisions or outcomes. For Apple HI, the most differentiating work was completely absent from the document. The resume got a recruiter screen anyway (strong signal about the portfolio/brand logos), but it was working against the candidacy, not for it. The rewrite adds the thesis, digital twin, and Stanford first place in a new Current Work section, rewrites the summary around the positioning line, and bridges each experience entry to interaction design thinking.
Confidence: High. The gap was concrete and observable.
